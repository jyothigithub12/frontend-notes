      //steps to create the game

      // 1. when we click on the button, it will call the function and generate a random number
      // 2. create a function that generates a random number between 0 and 12.
      // 3. computer randomly chooses rock, paper or scissors.
      // 4. compare the moves to get the result
      // 5. display the result to the POPUP window.

      // scopes of variables:
      // 1. global scope: variables that are declared outside of any function or block. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
      // 2. local scope: variables that are declared inside a function or block. They can only be accessed from within that function or block.
      // 3. block scope: variables that are declared inside a block (e.g., if statement, for loop). They can only be accessed from within that block.
      // 4. function scope: variables that are declared inside a function. They can only be accessed from within that function.
      // scope will avoid the naming conflicts between variables.
