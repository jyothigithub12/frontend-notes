    <!-- // Objects are a data type that can store multiple values in a single variable.
// They are often used to represent complex data structures, such as a person, car, or product.
// Objects are defined using curly braces {} and can contain key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value can be any data type.
// Objects can also contain methods, which are functions that are associated with the object.  
// Methods are defined using the same syntax as functions, but they are defined inside the object.
// Objects can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation. Dot notation is used to access properties and methods of an object using the dot operator (.), while bracket notation is used to access properties and methods of an object using square brackets ([]).  -->
