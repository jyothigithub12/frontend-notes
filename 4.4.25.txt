Interface: Interfaces are a powerful feature that allows developers to define the structure of objects.(interface is nothing but custome datatype.)

    Syntax:

        interface InterfaceName {
            properties
            methods declarations
        }
        class ClassName implements InterfaceName {    //interface is used for classes.
       
        }

        >>InterfaceName Should be pascalCase.(staring from first word first letter capital.)

Union: Using union we can include multiple data types to a variable.

    Syntax:
    variable: dataType; (its a general Syntax for assigning variable)

    union Syntax:

    variableName: dataType1 | dataType2 | dataType3;
    usernames: string | Array<string>; (here for user we can pass direct string or array of string).

    id: number | string;
 
Abstract refers to the process of simplifying complex systems or concepts by focusing on 
essential features and hiding unnecessary details, making them easier to understand and manage.

Abstract Classes: it is mainly used for inheritance.(we can declare the method in the parent class and can be used for child class.)

I
    Syntax:

        abstract class ClassName { //abstract is a predefined keyword.
            // Abstract(abstraction indicates declarations) and Non abstract methods(non abstract methods indicates implementations.)
            abstract methodName(param: datatype): returntype;
            methodName(param: datatype): returntype {
                
            }
        }
        class ClassName2 extends ClassName {
        }


        >>in Interface method implementations doesnot work.it can have only method declarations that why interface will have 100% abstraction.

        >> but abstract classes doesnot have 100% abstraction because it has both implementations and declarations.

        >> when we use abstract classes interface doesnot come into picture.

        >>abstraction can be achieved using interface(100% abstraction) and Abstract classes(we can achive 0-100% abstraction)
